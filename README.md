## User Guide

### Getting Started as a Manager

1. Open the app at `http://localhost:3004` (or your hosted URL).
2. Click **Register** and enter your name, email, password, and team name. This creates your account, your team, and an initial active season.
3. Log in. You land on the **Dashboard**, which shows your team's KPIs, upcoming games and trainings, and recent AI analysis highlights.

---

### Managing Your Roster

Navigate to **Players** in the bottom nav.

**Adding a player**
1. Tap **+** (or **Add Player**).
2. Fill in: first name, last name, jersey number, height, date of birth, playing positions, and whether the player is a libero or holds a referee licence.
3. Save. The player is added to your roster with a *pending* invite status.

**Inviting a player to log in**
1. Open the player's profile.
2. Tap **Send Invite**. The app generates a one-time invite link valid for 7 days.
3. Share the link with the player. When they follow it they set their email and password and their account is linked to their profile.

**Editing or deleting a player**
- Open the player profile and tap **Edit** to update any field.
- Upload or change a profile photo (JPEG/PNG, max 5 MB).
- Tap **Delete** to remove the player permanently. This cannot be undone.

---

### Organising Seasons

Seasons are intentionally tucked away. Access them via **Settings → Seasons**.

- A default active season is created on registration.
- Create additional seasons with a name, start date, and end date.
- Mark a season **active** to associate new matches with it.
- View per-season win/loss records and statistics.

---

### Scheduling and Managing Matches

Navigate to **Games** in the bottom nav.

**Creating a match**
1. Tap **+ New Game**.
2. Choose the match type:
   - **Playing** — your team is competing. Rotation tracking and live logging are available.
   - **Officiating** — your team is refereeing. Score tracking only.
3. Set opponent name, date, time, location, referees, and scorers.
4. The match is created with status **upcoming**.

**Editing match details**
- Open any match and tap **Edit** to update opponent, location, or officials.

**Filtering the match list**
- Use the **All / Playing / Officiating** toggle to narrow the list.
- Upcoming and completed matches are shown in separate sections.

---

### Live Match Logging

Open a **Playing** match and tap **Start / Continue Logging**.

The live logging screen (`GameLog`) is designed for one-handed use during a real match.

**Scoring a rally**
- Tap **Us** or **Them** depending on who won the point.
- Select a **point type**: positive play (ace, kill, block) or error (unforced error, reception error, etc.).
- The score updates instantly. Rotation advances automatically when your team wins a rally while receiving.

**Logging a substitution**
- Tap **Sub** and choose the player going out and the player coming in.
- The app enforces the standard limit of 6 regular substitutions per set. Libero swaps are tracked separately.

**Logging a timeout**
- Tap **Timeout** and choose whether it was called by **us** or **them**.

**Starting a new set**
- When a set ends, tap **New Set**. The app creates Set 2 (or 3, etc.) and initialises the lineup.

**Undoing the last rally**
- Tap **Undo** to remove the most recent rally and restore the previous score and rotation.

**Real-time stats during the match**
- The **Stats** tab in the live screen shows live TUS (Timeout Urgency Score), error ratio by rotation, and score context — all computed client-side with zero latency.

**Match completion**
- The match is automatically marked **completed** when a team wins 3 sets (or your configured set threshold).
- Post-match AI analysis is triggered immediately after completion.

---

### Match Statistics and AI Analysis

Open any completed match and switch to the **Stats** tab.

**What's shown**
- Final score and set-by-set breakdown.
- Point distribution: positive plays vs errors per set.
- Rotation efficiency: which of the 6 rotation positions performed best/worst.
- TUS timeline: a graph of Timeout Urgency Score across the match, showing momentum swings.
- Error clustering: whether errors came in streaks (Wald-Wolfowitz test) or were random.

**AI Analysis tab**
The analysis service runs a full statistical pipeline in the background (~30 seconds). The frontend polls every 3 seconds and displays results as soon as they are ready. The analysis covers:

- **Strengths** — rotations, serve-receive patterns, or substitution combinations that produced positive outcomes.
- **Weaknesses** — areas where error clustering or negative TUS trends were detected.
- **Action items** — specific drill recommendations ranked by expected impact.
- **Monte Carlo simulation** — 10 000 simulated matches based on observed point probabilities, estimating win likelihood under different lineup strategies.
- **Substitution impact** — whether substitutions shifted point-scoring rates.
- **Timeout impact** — whether called timeouts produced a measurable score-momentum change.

If fewer than 20 rallies were logged the analysis returns **Insufficient data**.

---

### Training Sessions

Navigate to **Trainings** in the bottom nav.

**Creating a session (manager)**
1. Tap **+ New Training**.
2. Set title, date, start time, end time, location, notes, and optional focus tags (e.g. *serve*, *block*, *reception*).
3. Save. All players are auto-enrolled with status **pending**.

**Managing attendance**
- Open a session to see the attendance list.
- Tap a player's status to change it to **Coming** or **Not Coming** on their behalf.

**Deleting a session**
- Open the session and tap **Delete**.

---

### Training Priorities

After match analysis completes, the system may generate **Training Priorities** — specific metrics that need improvement based on recent match insights.

Access them from the **Dashboard** (pinned cards) or via the API.

Each priority shows:
- The metric to improve (e.g., *reception error rate in rotation 3*).
- A baseline value (from the source match) and a target value.
- Outcome history: how the metric moved in subsequent matches.
- Status: **Active**, **Improving**, **Resolved**, **Regressed**, or **Dismissed**.

A manager can update the note on a priority or dismiss it from the active list.

---

### Player Guide

When a manager sends you an invite link:
1. Follow the link to the **Accept Invite** page.
2. Enter your email and choose a password.
3. Log in.

As a player, you can:
- View your own profile (name, positions, jersey, height).
- View your team's match list and individual match statistics.
- View AI analysis for completed matches.
- See upcoming training sessions.
- RSVP to training sessions by changing your own attendance status to **Coming** or **Not Coming**.

You cannot create matches, edit other players' data, or manage the roster.

## Developer Guide

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS |
| State / Data | Zustand + TanStack Query |
| Backend | Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 |
| Analysis | Python 3.11 + FastAPI |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose |

### Architecture Overview

```
Browser (React)
    │
    ├─ REST calls ──► Express API (port 3005)
    │                     │
    │                     ├─ Prisma ──► PostgreSQL (port 5446)
    │                     │
    │                     └─ HTTP ──► FastAPI Analysis Service (port 8001)
    │                                       │
    │                                       └─ psycopg2 ──► PostgreSQL
    │
    └─ Polling (every 3 s) ──► GET /api/games/:id/analysis
```

**Key design decisions:**
- Rotation logic is mirrored in `web/src/lib/rotation.ts` and `api/src/lib/rotation.ts` so the frontend can compute rotations locally with no round-trip during live logging.
- TUS is computed fully client-side during a live match for zero-latency display, then recomputed server-side for persistence.
- Post-match analysis is asynchronous: the API triggers a `POST /analyse/:id` call to the analysis service, then the frontend polls `GET /api/games/:id/analysis` until `status === "ready"`.
- Seasons are intentionally hidden from the main navigation. They are only accessible through Settings to reduce cognitive load during live matches.

---

### Local Development

Run each service in a separate terminal. You need PostgreSQL 15 running locally first.

**API (Express)**
```bash
cd api
npm install
cp ../.env.example .env
# Edit .env: set DATABASE_URL to your local postgres, e.g.:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/vbscout
npx prisma db push       # apply schema
npm run dev              # runs on http://localhost:3005
```

**Frontend (React + Vite)**
```bash
cd web
npm install
# VITE_API_URL defaults to http://localhost:3005 in dev
npm run dev              # runs on http://localhost:5173
```

**Analysis Service (FastAPI)**
```bash
cd analysis-service
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set DATABASE_URL to your local postgres
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
# Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

| `Team` | Top-level tenant; owns all players, seasons, and matches |
| `Player` | Roster member with positions, jersey number, and optional user link |
| `Season` | Date-bounded grouping for matches; one season is active at a time |
| `Match` | A game (playing or officiating) with score, sets, and analysis result |
| `MatchPlayer` | Junction: which players were part of a specific match |
| `Set` | One set within a match; holds the starting lineup and score |
| `Rally` | Single point logged in a set; carries score snapshot and rotation state |
| `Substitution` | Player swap within a set |
| `Timeout` | Timeout event within a set |
| `TrainingSession` | Scheduled training with focus tags |

| `MatchAnalysis` | Analysis result (status + JSON insights) keyed per match |
| `TrainingPriority` | Actionable training recommendation generated from analysis |
| `PriorityOutcome` | Tracks how a priority metric changed in subsequent matches |

**Applying schema changes:**
```bash
cd api
npx prisma db push        # dev / Docker (no migration files)
# or
npx prisma migrate dev    # if you want tracked migration history
```

**Prisma Studio (GUI):**
```bash

### Auth System

**Roles:**
- `manager` — full write access to all team resources
- `player` — read access to team data, write access to own RSVP only

**Token storage:** httpOnly cookies (`Secure` in production, `SameSite=Lax`). No tokens are stored in `localStorage`.

**Access token TTL:** 7 days. **Refresh token TTL:** 30 days.

**Password hashing:** bcrypt, cost factor 12.

**Player invite flow:**
1. Manager calls `POST /api/auth/invite/:playerId` → receives a signed 7-day JWT invite token.
2. Manager shares the invite URL with the player.
3. Player calls `POST /api/auth/accept-invite` with the token, email, and chosen password → account is created and linked to the player record.
